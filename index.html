      Echidnas (<span class="phonetic">/ɪˈkɪdnə/</span>), sometimes known as
      spiny anteaters,[1] belong to the family Tachyglossidae in the monotreme
      order of egg-laying mammals. The four extant species of Echidnas and the
      platypus are the only living mammals that lay eggs and the only surviving
      members of the order Monotremata. The diet of some species consists of
      ants and termites, but they are not closely related to the true anteaters
      of the Americas, which are xenarthrans, along with sloths and armadillos.
      Echidnas live in Australia and New Guinea.

    <p>
      Echidnas evolved between 20 and 50 million years ago, descending from a
      platypus-like monotreme. This ancestor was aquatic, but echidnas adapted
      to life on land.

    <p>
      The echidnas are named after Echidna, a creature from Greek mythology who
      was half-woman, half-snake, as the animal was perceived to have qualities
      of both mammals and reptiles
