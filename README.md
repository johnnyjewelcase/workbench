# Responsive Design in Bootstrap

I've created a simple site to demonstrate a few Bootstrap elements and respond to screen size. Margins, navbar, and my name change depending on the pixel width of the browser. There's also a sticky footer!

The main challenges for me were getting my own css file to compliment Bootstrap's, overriding when necessary, as well as my tendency to add more div wrappers than necessary.

## TO-DO

use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site
